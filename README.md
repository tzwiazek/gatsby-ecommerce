## ðŸš€ Quick start

An unfinished e-commerce project, made to learn gatsby.

Gatsby is commonly used as a static site generator. However, in this project I wanted to check if it can be used as a shop. At first i wanted to check if product page, cart and checkout works. In future i will complete design and add new functionalities like favorites page, blog, user account etc.
